# Research Interest

I explain what Kitaoka has primarily researched (as of Octorber 11, 2025).


## Inverse optimization for Mixed-integer programming
- We aim to learn objective functions and constraints of MILP such that the given data is the optimal solution.

## Counterfactual explanation, Algorithmic recourse
- I am researching counterfactual explanations, i.e., AIs that explain “how to modify the current input to obtain the desired output”.

## Learning of averaged data
- Data aggregation techniques, including data averaging, are useful for data summarization, compression, reducing annotation costs, improving data quality, and protecting privacy.
- We are researching methods for machine learning from averaged data.

## Algorithm of approximating minimal geodesics
- I was conducting research on estimating errors in length minimization through energy minimization of curves in real coordinate space using finite difference methods and numerical integration.

## Invariants of Parabolic Geometry with BGG Complexes
- I was particularly interested in the relationship between geometric invariants of the de Rham complex and the (curved) Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand complex on contact geometry or parabolic geometry.
